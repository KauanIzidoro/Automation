# Automation Season 1/4

## Topics Covered This Semester:
- Basic structure of microcontroller programming;
- Digital signal I/O;
- Analog signal I/O;
- Peripheral control: LCD display, Matrix keypad;
- Development of CRUD systems.

  ## Highlights
- For the initial projects, the use of functions to manipulate digital/analog signals and hardware mapping was put into practice, such as: pinMode(), digitalWrite(), digitalRead(), analogRead();
- Use of the integrated serial terminal, and integration of components simulating real-life scenarios like sensors, transducers, and buttons;
- For the final projects, there was a requirement for peripheral control, along with the implementation of key data structures such as arrays and matrices.



## Basic Structure of Microcontroller Programming

Microcontroller programming involves using languages like C/C++ to develop software that controls and interacts with electronic devices. Programs are designed to perform specific tasks in embedded systems, such as automation systems, IoT devices, and robotics. They typically include functions for initialization, pin configuration (I/O), sensor reading, actuator control, and communication with other devices.

## Digital Signal I/O

Digital signals in microcontrollers refer to the ability to read and write binary values (0 or 1) on specific pins. Input pins can be read to determine logical states (high or low), while output pins can be configured to send logical levels to external devices. Programming involves functions to configure, read, and write digital signals, enabling communication and control of simple digital devices.

## Analog Signal I/O

Analog signals in microcontrollers allow the reading of continuous quantities such as temperature, light intensity, and voltage. Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) is essential for converting analog signals into digital values that the microcontroller can process. Similarly, digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) enables the microcontroller to output analog signals for controlling devices that require continuous variation of values, such as motors and power control circuits.

## Peripheral Control: LCD Display, Matrix Keypad

Controlling peripherals like LCD displays and matrix keypads involves direct interaction between the microcontroller and human interface devices. For LCD displays, programming includes initialization, pin configuration, sending commands and data for displaying text and graphics. Matrix keypad reading involves scanning rows and columns to detect pressed keys. Specific libraries or custom codes are used to efficiently manage interaction with these peripherals.

## CRUD System Development

The development of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) systems involves creating applications that manage data in a database or local storage comprehensively. For microcontrollers, this may include systems that capture data from sensors (Create), read and process this data (Read), update settings or values (Update), and occasionally delete obsolete or unused data (Delete). Programming for CRUD in microcontrollers may involve the use of efficient data structures, and optimized algorithms for data manipulation.
